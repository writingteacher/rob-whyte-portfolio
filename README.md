# Sinorbis
Based in Sydney, Australia, this SaaS CMS provides a drag and drop web builder for entrepreneurs hoping to create an online presence in China. In addition to the intuitive UI, Sinorbis' hosting service delivers web access on the other side of China's Great Firewall.

#### The problem
The company needed a knowledge base to support its rapidly growing client base and revamp its technical support system.
