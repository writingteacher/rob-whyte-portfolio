##### The problem  
The company needed a knowledge base to support its rapidly growing client base and revamp its technical support system. 

##### My role  
I built the company knowledge base form scratch. The work started with a rough infromation architecture mapped out on a few  PPT slides. Some eighteen months later, the help site had reach maturity. I was lft mostly on my own to figure out the ystem though there were occassiona collaborative meets with the Customer Success Manager to review prioriy deliverables and answer FAQs. Today, I continue to provide occassion maintenace support by writing how-to articles for new features.
