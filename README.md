## About
<img id="img" style="float:right; padding-left:30px; padding-bottom:30px;" src="rob-whyte.jpg" alt="rob whyte technical writer" class="responsive-a" >  Rob has been writing professionally for 25+ years. Fresh out of graduate school (M.Sc. Urban Planning), he wrote technical reports and proposals for an environmental consultancy in Toronto. Eager to explore the world, he moved to Asia, where the Wheel of Fortuna showed her hand.

A freelance technical writer since 2018, he specializes in user documentation for SaaS platforms. Before that, he honed his professional writing chops as a Lonely Planet author and learned the art of simplifying instructions as a teacher. 

Rob comes to technical writing with an ear for plain English communication, a head for breaking down complex operations, and an eye for documentation that reduces user friction.
